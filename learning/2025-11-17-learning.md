<!-- PRATEEK KUMAR -->
We created a well-structured repository named “OJT_PROJECT” to organize all our work.
Inside it, we added important .md files such as README.md to document our goals and progress.
We also set up dedicated folders like “code” for implementation and “learning” for research notes.
Each section is updated regularly as we continue improving the project.
This structure keeps our workflow clear, organized, and easy to maintain.
It also reflects our commitment to learning, teamwork, and professional development.
